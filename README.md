## Need For JMaaS

* Unmanaged Expansion of Projects and Users with Prolonged Jira Usage leads to more space and cost
* Accumulation of Unused and Unmanageable Custom Data and integration apps
* Inconsistency Due to Teams Using Different Operational / Workflow Processes
* Struggling to operate efficiently with the latest integrations and features
* Manually querying the platform for preparing the inventory data leads to time consuming and dependent task item
* Heavy time spend on finding the collisions from  source and target with respect to migration and consolidation
* Heavy impact on business continuity due to huge downtime during the migration
* Not fully functional Jira after data migration due to lack of version compatibility checks, Integration checks

How we intend to support our customers with this framework based on our industry experiences:
* Suggestion on the best practices to follow as we have a deeper knowledge on the platform architecture and its components design
